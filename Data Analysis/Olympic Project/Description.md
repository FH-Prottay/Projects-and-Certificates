 **Project Name: Olympic Games Analysis and Visualization** üåç

I analyzed historical data from the Olympic Games, spanning from 1896 to the 2016 Rio Olympics. Here's a breakdown of what I did:

1. **Data Analysis and Cleaning:**
   - Analyzed data from the Olympic Games from 1896 to 2016.
   - Identified and handled null values to ensure data integrity.
   - Used query functions to extract details of individual countries' performances.

2. **Visualizations:**
   - Created visualizations to highlight key insights:
     - Top 10 countries by participation.
     - Age distribution of athletes, noting that six athletes aged 60 and above won gold medals.
     - Differentiated events by Summer and Winter Olympics and by gender.
     - Showed that 27.5% of total athletes were female, with a notable increase in women's participation over the years.

3. **Key Insights:**
   - Identified that the USA won the highest number of gold medals (2638) from 1896 to 2016.
   - Highlighted the USA's top position in securing the maximum number of gold medals in the 2016 Rio Olympics.

4. **Tools and Techniques:**
   - Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Seaborn for visualizations, and Matplotlib for plotting graphs.
   - Leveraged data querying to derive specific insights for countries and events.
