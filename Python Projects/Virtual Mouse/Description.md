This Python code utilizes OpenCV, PyAutoGUI, and Mediapipe libraries to create a virtual mouse controlled by hand movements. The script captures live video from a webcam, detects hand landmarks, and translates specific hand movements into mouse cursor actions. Here's a brief overview:

**Import Libraries:** OpenCV for video capture and processing, PyAutoGUI for controlling the mouse, and Mediapipe for hand landmark detection.
**Initialize Video Capture:** Opens the webcam for capturing video.
**Hand Detector Setup:** Initializes Mediapipe's hand detection and drawing utilities.
**Screen Size:** Retrieves the screen dimensions using PyAutoGUI.
**Main Loop:** Continuously captures frames from the webcam.
**Frame Processing:** Converts frames to RGB, detects hand landmarks, and draws them on the frame.
**Cursor Movement:** Maps the coordinates of the index finger's tip to screen dimensions, moving the mouse cursor accordingly.
**Click Detection:** Detects when the thumb and pinky fingers are close to simulate a mouse click.

The resulting application allows users to control their mouse cursor and click using hand gestures in front of a webcam.
